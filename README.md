## Hi there 👋

- 🏡 I was born and raised in a small town in the center of Russia.
- 🎓 I graduated from Saratov University with a degree in programming.
- 👨‍🏫 All my life, I’ve worked in schools, colleges, and universities, teaching students programming.
- 📚 I’ve learned a ton of languages and technologies—the list is embarrassingly long.
- 🔍 Now I study what interests me, not just what’s required by the curriculum.
- 🎨 I believe programming is an art, and I haven’t regretted my choice for a second.
